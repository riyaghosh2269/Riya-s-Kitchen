        Chingri Malaikari is a luxurious Bengali dish made with prawns (chingri) cooked in a rich, creamy coconut milk gravy.
It is often made with large tiger prawns or golda chingri, which are prized for their taste and texture.
The name "malaikari" is believed to have been derived from "Malai", referring to the creamy coconut base.
Prawns are lightly fried and then simmered in a sauce made from coconut milk, onions, ginger, garlic, and aromatic spices.
A hint of garam masala and ghee is often added for extra depth and richness.
The dish has a subtle sweetness balanced by the warmth of spices, making it comforting yet festive.
Chingri Malaikari is a popular choice for weddings, celebrations, and special occasions.
It is best served with fragrant basmati rice or plain white rice.
The creamy texture of the gravy pairs perfectly with the tender prawns.
Loved across Bengal, this dish showcases the regionâ€™s love for seafood and delicate flavors.
