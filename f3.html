        Pulao is a fragrant and mildly spiced rice dish popular across India, especially in Bengali cuisine.
It is typically made with basmati rice cooked with whole spices like cardamom, cinnamon, and bay leaves.
Often, ghee is used to enhance the aroma and richness of the dish.
Vegetables, nuts like cashews and raisins, or even meat can be added depending on the variation.
Bengali-style pulao is slightly sweet and pairs well with spicy curries like kosha mangsho or chingri malaikari.
Saffron or turmeric may be used to give the rice a beautiful golden hue.
Fried onions are often used as a garnish, adding both flavor and texture.
It is commonly served during festivals, weddings, and other special occasions.
Pulao strikes a balance between simplicity and elegance, making it a crowd favorite.
Light yet flavorful, it serves as a perfect main dish or complement to richer accompaniments.
