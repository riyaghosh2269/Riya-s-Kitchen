      Ilish Bhapa is a classic Bengali delicacy made with hilsa fish, one of the most cherished fishes in Bengali cuisine.
The word "bhapa" means "steamed", and this dish is known for its rich, aromatic mustard flavor.
Fresh hilsa pieces are marinated in a paste of mustard seeds, green chilies, turmeric, and mustard oil.
The marinated fish is then steamed, often wrapped in banana leaves to enhance its flavor.
Mustard oil adds a sharp, pungent aroma that pairs beautifully with the soft, oily texture of hilsa.
The dish is simple, yet intensely flavorful, capturing the essence of Bengali culinary tradition.
Ilish Bhapa is often prepared during monsoon season when hilsa is at its best.
It is commonly served with plain white rice, allowing the mustard gravy to shine.
This dish is especially popular during festivals and special family gatherings.
Loved for its bold taste and minimal ingredients, Ilish Bhapa remains a timeless favorite.
